This suggests that smoking may have more pronounced effects on women’s cardiovascular health in middle age, possibly due to interactions with hormonal changes."

This indicates that smoking cessation alone may not eliminate the cardiovascular burden in socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, likely due to other persistent risk factors (diet, stress, healthcare access, environmental exposures)."

This is unexpected because it suggests that area deprivation and individual age are independent risk factors rather than correlated variables. People of all ages live in both deprived and affluent areas. Additionally, CVD cases appear across the entire deprivation spectrum, though visual inspection suggests slightly higher density in more deprived areas (positive Carstairs scores). This reinforces that while deprivation increases CVD risk at the population level, substantial numbers of people in affluent areas still develop CVD due to other risk factors."

Additionally, the wide distribution and numerous outliers indicate substantial individual variation, many people in highly deprived areas don’t smoke, and some in affluent areas do."
